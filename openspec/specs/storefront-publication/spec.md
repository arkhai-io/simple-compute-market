# Storefront Publication Specification

## Purpose

Define seller storefront ownership, listing publication/reconciliation, and domain-runtime composition.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Seller protocol surface
A storefront MUST expose authenticated listing, negotiation, settlement, identity, health, and operator control surfaces while keeping domain-specific behavior behind injected adapters.

#### Scenario: Buyer settles accepted terms
- **WHEN** the buyer submits a settlement request for an accepted negotiation
- **THEN** the storefront verifies the agreed terms and settlement evidence before scheduling fulfillment

### Requirement: Operator-visible acceptance state
The storefront MUST expose enough operator state to distinguish global negotiation pause from listing state and an empty resource projection from an inventory import failure.

#### Scenario: Storefront is globally paused
- **WHEN** a buyer starts a negotiation while global pause is active
- **THEN** the storefront rejects it with HTTP 503 and a global-pause reason until an authenticated operator resumes the process

#### Scenario: Storefront has no imported resources
- **WHEN** the active storefront database contains no resource rows
- **THEN** system status reports `resource_count` as zero and new negotiations cannot match inventory

### Requirement: Registry publication ownership
A storefront MUST publish, update, close, and reconcile its listings against one or more configured registries using its publisher identity.

#### Scenario: Derived capacity disappears
- **WHEN** authoritative capacity no longer supports a derived listing
- **THEN** reconciliation closes that listing in configured registries without treating stale local state as authority

### Requirement: Domain publication capability
A domain that supports seller publication MUST provide its publication source and listing interpretation through the domain contract while registry fan-out remains schema-opaque core orchestration.

#### Scenario: Domain publication plugin is selected
- **WHEN** an operator selects a registered domain source
- **THEN** the core runner invokes it through the publication-source contract and publishes its opaque payloads

#### Scenario: Domain capacity changes
- **WHEN** a domain publication source observes a change in its authoritative inventory or quota
- **THEN** it produces domain listings through its contract and the shared runner publishes or reconciles their opaque payloads

### Requirement: Domain runtime composition
The shared storefront role MUST consume the selected market-domain contract for listing, message, agreed-terms, materialization, receipt, and result codecs plus the lifecycle hooks declared by that domain. A concrete storefront composition MUST supply its implementations explicitly, and generic storefront services MUST NOT import or branch on concrete domains.

#### Scenario: Current storefront composition selects a domain
- **WHEN** a VM or API-credit storefront is assembled
- **THEN** its composition root supplies a validated domain contract used by every shared storefront service that interprets domain behavior

#### Scenario: Domain validation fails
- **WHEN** a domain codec or hook rejects a payload
- **THEN** the storefront surfaces the domain validation failure without coercing it through a different domain or a generic fallback

### Requirement: Trusted provisioning-site identity
A storefront MUST bind each provisioning connection to an operator-configured `site_id`. It MUST derive routing and ownership from that trusted binding rather than accepting a counterparty-provided site identity.

#### Scenario: Provisioner reports a conflicting site identity
- **WHEN** a configured provisioning connection reports a `site_id` different from the storefront binding
- **THEN** the storefront retains the configured identity and rejects or ignores the conflicting assertion

### Requirement: Storefronts cache independent site projections
Individual-resource publication consumes `site_resource_pools`, which carries the physical inventory facts required to create a listing for a specific resource. Capacity-oriented publication consumes vertically grouped `site_capacity_buckets`. Grouped capacity is advisory publication input only and is never an allocation target; authoritative reservation admission remains host-granular inside the provisioning site authority.

A storefront SHALL load the resource-pool and capacity-bucket projections at startup, poll their independent revision-and-digest identities, and replace each cached generation atomically. Refresh failure SHALL retain the last complete generation and mark it stale rather than representing an empty projection. Topology-sensitive authoritative errors MAY trigger one coalesced drift check but SHALL NOT automatically retry a state-changing request.

#### Scenario: One projection refresh fails
- **WHEN** a storefront cannot refresh one site projection after previously loading a complete generation
- **THEN** it retains that generation as stale without replacing the other independently versioned projection

## Evidence

- Generic publication source, runner, and plugin discovery: `core/storefront/tests/unit/test_publication_sources.py`, `test_publication_runner.py`, and `test_publication_plugins.py`.
- Registry fan-out and publication persistence: `core/storefront/tests/unit/test_registry_publication.py` and `domains/vms/storefront/tests/unit/test_publications_wiring.py`.
- Domain-runtime bundle and VM wiring: `core/storefront/tests/unit/test_domain_runtime.py` and `domains/vms/storefront/tests/unit/test_domain_runtime_wiring.py`.
- Global pause state: `domains/vms/storefront/tests/unit/test_order_pause_state.py` and `tests/integration/test_admin_api.py`.
- Resource-count diagnosis: `domains/vms/storefront/src/market_storefront/services/system_service.py` and `e2e-tests/tests/smoke/test_storefront_smoke.py`.

Replacing the domain-owned storefront executables remains proposed work rather than baseline behavior. Bare metal currently supplies domain codecs and publication semantics but not a complete runnable storefront composition.
