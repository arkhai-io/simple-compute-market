# Testing and Compatibility Architecture

The [normative contract](spec.md) defines established test boundaries. This document explains how each test level contributes different evidence and how asynchronous cross-service flows remain deterministic.

## Test jurisdiction

Use the lowest level that can prove the behavior:

| Level | Primary evidence |
|---|---|
| Unit | Pure transformations, validation, state transitions, and policy with injected collaborators |
| Service integration | Persistence, dependency wiring, HTTP mapping, authentication, retries, and one service's client behavior |
| Contract/conformance | A shared producer/consumer session or carrier interpreted by independent implementations |
| Smoke | Deployed reachability, basic configuration, and stateless wiring |
| System/e2e | Major lifecycle contracts spanning deployed authorities |

Higher-level tests do not repeat every lower-level branch. They prove that independently tested components compose through their public boundaries.

## Producer and consumer contracts

A cross-package fixture is an executable contract. The producer owns a minimal canonical builder and validates its own output; consumers validate required semantics while tolerating nondeterministic identifiers or timestamps. Shared fixtures live in an installed owning namespace so tests exercise package boundaries rather than checkout-relative files.

Use a shared fixture only when independent implementations must agree. The API-credits middleware conformance session is the clearest current example: Python, TypeScript, and Rust gates consume one observable protocol while keeping implementation internals separate.

## Deterministic asynchronous seams

A sleep is not evidence that a lifecycle transition occurred. Deterministic asynchronous tests use one or more of:

- an observable accepted/queued state;
- a server-side wait or long poll;
- a test-control gate that pauses execution at a named boundary;
- a public or test-only event/status surface.

A gate allows a test to assert the intermediate state before deliberately permitting completion. Test controls remain separate from buyer/public APIs and must not become production authority.

## Staged system tests

A staged scenario names each produced field and each downstream prerequisite. Consumers require the exact state they use and skip clearly when an upstream stage did not produce it, avoiding cascades of misleading failures.

The VM full-deal coverage uses complementary vehicles: a controlled flow gives precise assertions at intermediate boundaries, while a real buyer-CLI flow proves buyer-visible composition. Both traverse publication, negotiation, settlement, fulfillment, ready state, and release without making e2e own every component semantic.

Scenario fixtures create the precise resource and policy state they assert, remain idempotent across reruns, and clean up state that ordinary lifecycle timing cannot safely reclaim during the test.

## Boundary-change evidence

A moved or extracted boundary may require wheel-content checks, typing markers, dependency-direction tests, consumer suites, composition startup, duplicate-registration checks, and retry/idempotency coverage in addition to ordinary unit tests. Which checks apply follows the authority being changed.

## Hosted settlement evidence lanes

Hosted settlement uses a producer/consumer split. The independently released
authority owns service conformance, deterministic provider behavior, private
control artifacts, and signed release identity. This repository owns the
marketplace lifecycle scenario and consumes only exact release artifacts.
Neither repository imports the other's implementation source.

The hermetic lane supplies deterministic finance, time, and event delivery
behind authenticated private controls. The marketplace still reaches the
authority and storefront only through their ordinary public clients; the
private runner may plan outcomes and inspect a bounded normalized effect by
stable operation reference. Clean runs remove authority, simulator, and clock
volumes, while restart scenarios deliberately retain them.

Real Stripe compatibility is a separate evidence lane because Checkout UI,
webhook signing, connected-account readiness, provider retrieval, transfer,
and refund behavior cannot be inferred from a simulator. Its report carries
the consumer commit and hosted release/workflow identities independently from
the hermetic report. Local EAS/arbiter conformance is likewise separate from
the default wallet-free portable-condition path.

## Current limits

The e2e harness predominantly uses HTTP clients and explicit test seams, but it is not yet completely external to service packages and a few scenarios retain timing or private-client dependencies. The architecture therefore states the desired boundary only where current tests establish it and treats full harness extraction as separate work.

Repository-wide typed-client ownership, universal sync/async parity, and a closed list of raw-HTTP exceptions are not established baseline guarantees.
