# Physical Provisioning Architecture

The [normative contract](spec.md) defines executor dispatch, jobs, and release. This document explains how the compute service composes generic lifecycle machinery with domain adapters.

## Compute composition

The compute service owns transport, persistence, job execution infrastructure, lease lifecycle, and registration of concrete adapter bundles. Domain adapters own infrastructure-specific request validation, invocation, result interpretation, and credentials.

```text
compute service composition
    ├── generic jobs and lease lifecycle
    ├── site and resource-pool authorities
    ├── fulfillment scheduler/registry
    └── VM, bare-metal, or future adapter bundles
```

This replaces a VM-shaped provisioning core with an executor-neutral composition root. Generic services can dispatch by recorded executor or provider identity without importing a concrete domain implementation.

## Registration boundary

Adapters register executor actions and FulfillmentProviders explicitly. Duplicate identities fail during startup because silent replacement would make persisted records execute under a different implementation. Provider and executor registration remain independent: fulfillment create/status/teardown and lease-release actions have different contracts and may evolve separately.

## Durable jobs, transient workers

A persisted job gives accepted work a durable identity, status, request snapshot, result, and diagnostic history. The in-process queue is only the execution mechanism. It does not become the database, retry authority, or provider policy engine.

This distinction makes accepted work observable while avoiding false recovery promises. A process restart does not by itself prove that every queued or running action is safely resumed; recovery must be explicit where required.

## Selected-resource execution

Concrete providers operate on the Settlement Resource selected by fulfillment scheduling. The VM Ansible adapter resolves pool/provider configuration, validates it, and snapshots prepared inputs at dispatch. Administrative pool edits therefore affect later operations rather than rewriting the accepted execution.

Operational inventory is authoritative service state, not a checked-in Ansible inventory. Bootstrap inventory may import hosts, and an adapter may render transient execution inventory, but operator mutations and job-history references remain tied to persisted resources.

## Proof-driven release

Release is proof-driven and split across two cooperating owners. Lease lifecycle decides when a reservation should release and owns the final capacity-return decision; it never dispatches a second teardown operation. Fulfillment convergence (see `openspec/specs/fulfillment/spec.md#fulfillment-convergence-worker`) owns teardown dispatch, provider polling, and recovery through `torn_down`/`teardown_failed`. A kind-routed `ReleaseJobPort` connects the two: VM-backed reservations resolve release status by reading the fulfillment aggregate's teardown state; other executor kinds continue reading the shared job queue. The site authority releases capacity only after the fulfillment aggregate reaches `torn_down`, or an operator explicitly force-releases. Failure retains the reservation and records a retryable release state (`teardown_failed`), which convergence requeues on its own without an operator prompting it. An explicit force release is an operator override with distinct audit meaning, not fabricated proof of executor success.

Readiness checks use local service dependencies. Slower outbound provider or storefront diagnostics belong to operator surfaces so an external failure does not unnecessarily make a healthy API/worker process unready.

## Current limits

The compute service does not yet infer provider-to-executor linkage or establish universal multi-storefront event routing. Optional notification adapters are delivery mechanisms, not ownership authorities.

## Preserving provider operations across schema cutover

A provider job identifier is the durable correlation point for an in-flight Ansible run. Losing that correlation does not prove that creation failed or never occurred, so migration cannot safely compensate by launching another create playbook. The adapter remains the owner of provider metadata interpretation and teardown-envelope construction during both normal operation and cutover.
