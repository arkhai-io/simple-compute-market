## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Storefronts cache independent site projections
Individual-resource publication consumes `site_resource_pools`, which carries the physical inventory facts required to create a listing for a specific resource. Capacity-oriented publication consumes vertically grouped `site_capacity_buckets`. Grouped capacity is advisory publication input only and is never an allocation target; authoritative reservation admission remains resource-granular inside the provisioning site authority, which applies each pool provider's host requirement.

A storefront SHALL load the resource-pool and capacity-bucket projections at startup, poll their independent revision-and-digest identities, and replace each cached generation atomically. Refresh failure SHALL retain the last complete generation and mark it stale rather than representing an empty projection. Topology-sensitive authoritative errors MAY trigger one coalesced drift check but SHALL NOT automatically retry a state-changing request.

A storefront implementation MAY additionally support deriving publishable listing candidates from local, non-projection tables as a compatibility or staged-rollout path. Once that implementation's projection-backed candidate derivation has parity with its local-table path, the projection path SHALL be the default; a local-table path, if one still exists, is an explicit opt-in for rollback rather than the default behavior.

#### Scenario: One projection refresh fails
- **WHEN** a storefront cannot refresh one site projection after previously loading a complete generation
- **THEN** it retains that generation as stale without replacing the other independently versioned projection

#### Scenario: Projection-backed derivation has reached parity
- **WHEN** a storefront's projection-backed listing-candidate derivation has parity with any local-table path it retains
- **THEN** the projection path is that storefront's default, with the local-table path available only as an explicit, non-default rollback option
