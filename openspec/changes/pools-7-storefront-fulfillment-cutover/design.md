## Context

Captured during the `pools-3-fulfillment-provider` design-review session
(2026-07-15), before any implementation of `pools-3` existed. This file is
reference material for whoever picks this change up — it is not a design
this change has committed to; it records what was verified true at the
time so a future session doesn't have to re-derive it, and can verify it's
still true before proceeding.

## Current storefront fulfillment path (verified, not assumed)

1. `vm_fulfillment_service.py` reserves capacity against the site
   authority. The claim shape includes `required_attributes=("vm_host",)`
   — a specific physical host is chosen **before** any provisioning call,
   using `AggregateCapacityClient` placement policies (`fill_first`,
   `most_available`, `core_storefront/aggregation.py`). This is the
   layering issue `pools-4-storefront-capacity-boundary` targets.
2. `reserved_allocation_id` (from the reservation response) threads through
   the whole fulfillment flow — the storefront already carries
   `allocation_id` end to end today. That part is not new work.
3. `provisioning_orchestration_service.create_vm_and_wait_with_credentials`
   submits `ExecutorActionEnvelope(allocation_id=..., executor_kind="vm",
   action_kind="create", ...)` directly via `ComputeProvisioningClient`,
   then polls `client.poll_until_complete(...)` and fetches credentials
   itself. This is a complete, working, **already-async, caller-polls**
   pattern — the same shape `pools-3`'s `create()`/`get_status()` contract
   was designed to match, just against a different (lower-level, executor-
   kind-dispatched) entry point than `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` +
   `FulfillmentProvider`.

None of this touches `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` or any
`FulfillmentProvider`. The scheduler/provider path introduced by
`pools-2`/`pools-3` and the path the storefront actually uses are two
parallel systems today.

## `executor_kind` vs. `provider` — confirmed orthogonal, not layered

Raised and resolved during the `pools-3` design review: these are
different axes, and neither should be collapsed into the other by this
cutover.

- `executor_kind` (`"vm"` / `"bare_metal"`) is a **domain allocation
  semantics** distinction — VM allocations are shareable (many VMs per
  physical host), bare-metal allocations are exclusive (one allocation
  locks the whole host). It also selects which wire/request models and
  job actions are valid. It's decided once, at lease-registration time, by
  the market domain, and it's a pure lookup key for
  `ExecutorReleaseDispatcher` — the dispatcher doesn't choose a physical
  resource or a mechanism.
- `provider` (`"ansible"` today) is an **infrastructure mechanism**
  distinction — how to reach a resource (playbook and executor variables from the pool
  provider-configuration envelope). `ProviderRegistry` dispatches on this.
- `market-platform-compute-40-multi-domain-proof` is explicit evidence
  these coexist rather than one replacing the other: it proves
  "VM-shareable and bare-metal-exclusive allocations against the same
  physical host," in "one extracted compute provisioner [that] loads VM
  and bare-metal adapters concurrently." Bare-metal is planned to stay a
  separate *domain package*, not a separate *deployed provisioning
  service* — `domains/bare_metal` (`arkhai_bare_metal`) is a library today
  with no service/container of its own; it's imported by the VM
  provisioning service's `container.py` alongside VM release wiring, in
  the same process.

Implication for this change: when it wires release through
`ProviderRegistry`, that wiring is additive to (not a replacement for)
`ExecutorReleaseDispatcher`'s existing `executor_kind` routing — a
`SettlementRecord`-backed allocation resolves its provider via the
registry; an allocation with no `SettlementRecord` (not yet migrated to
the settlement path, or never will be) keeps using today's direct
`VmReleaseExecutor`/`BareMetalReleaseExecutor` behavior unchanged.

## Deferred items this change inherits

From `pools-3-fulfillment-provider` (see its `design.md` Decision 5 and
Risks):

- Wiring `VmReleaseExecutor` (or whatever replaces it) to resolve
  `SettlementRecord` → `ProviderRegistry.require(provider).teardown(...)`.
  `pools-3` built `FulfillmentProvider`/`ProviderRegistry` with no
  production caller and explicitly left the release path untouched to
  avoid designing that wiring against a guessed call shape.

From `pools-2-physical-settlement-scheduler` (see its `tasks.md`
"Remaining follow-on work"):

- "Persist Capacity Settlement Assignments and round-robin cursors
  transactionally." `select_resource()` has no production caller today
  (only tests call it), so this was low-urgency when `pools-2` and
  `pools-3` were built, but a production caller changes that — restart
  safety starts to matter once real reservations flow through it. Decide
  at that point whether `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` should write through
  `SettlementRecord` directly (one durable table, `pending` state before
  a provider ever executes) or keep separate assignment storage.
- "Move the concrete resource capacity claim from initial reservation into
  the assignment transaction" and "Enforce exactly-one-pool membership at
  the database layer" are also still open per that task list and are
  relevant once reservations stop being host-shaped (`pools-4`).

## Durable idempotency and dispatch recovery decisions

POOLS-7 MUST make the database the correctness boundary for fulfillment
idempotency. Process-local or asynchronous locks are insufficient because the
provisioning service may have multiple replicas and may restart between steps.

The durable fulfillment identity is keyed by `allocation_id`:

```text
allocation_id -> settlement/fulfillment record -> provider operation metadata
```

The persistence design MUST enforce these semantics transactionally:

- an equivalent retry returns the existing fulfillment and does not dispatch a
  second provider operation;
- a request that reuses the allocation with a different agreement, selected
  resource, provider, or fulfillment identity fails with a conflict; and
- teardown is similarly idempotent and does not dispatch uncontrolled duplicate
  work.

The design must explicitly handle the failure window between committing the
fulfillment identity and recording the asynchronous provider operation. A small
durable dispatch state machine or equivalent outbox/recovery pattern is
required. Executor-level deterministic command identity may be used as a final
defense around recovery, but `AnsibleJobService` is not the primary business
idempotency authority.

Pool provider configuration is resolved and snapshotted into executor inputs at
dispatch time so later pool edits cannot change accepted work. The persisted
record must retain the original selected resource, provider, and sufficient
provider metadata for later asynchronous teardown. Final teardown states and
record retention are designed here when the real lease-release call path is
wired.

## Remaining open questions for whoever picks this up

- Does `AggregateCapacityClient`'s `fill_first`/`most_available` placement
  logic get deleted outright once `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` owns
  placement, or does it downgrade to a pool-level preference hint passed
  into `SettlementRequirement.attributes`? Not analyzed this session.
- Whether `market-platform-compute-30-extract-service`'s absorbed
  package-boundary decision (stay VM-service-local vs. move to
  `compute_provisioning`; formerly tracked by the now-closed
  `pools-5-shared-provisioning-package`) should be forced by this change
  rather than waited on — if the storefront is going to depend on these contracts
  cross-service, that's itself an argument for moving them out of a
  VM-domain-local package. Worth revisiting at activation time rather than
  deciding here.
- **Operator listing-mode hints via `ResourcePool.policy_tags`** (raised
  during `pools-4`'s design review, 2026-07-16 — verified, not assumed):

  - `PhysicalSettlementScheduler._eligible_candidates`
    (`domains/vms/provisioning/service/src/services/physical_settlement_scheduler.py`)
    already filters `SiteResource.attributes["pool_id"]` against
    `ResourcePoolService.list_pools()` — i.e. it already assumes a
    `SiteResource`'s `pool_id` attribute reflects a *real* operator-managed
    Resource Pool. But no code was found that syncs `ResourcePoolService`
    pool membership into `SiteResource.attributes`. The only caller of
    `CapacityLedgerService.register_resource` today is the storefront's own
    `sync_site_resources()` (`market_storefront/services/capacity_client.py`),
    pushing its locally-managed CSV/listing attributes — which, per
    `pools-4`'s design review, are not guaranteed to carry a `pool_id` that
    corresponds to any `ResourcePoolService` pool at all. This gap hasn't
    bitten anything yet only because `select_resource` has no production
    caller (per `pools-2`'s own remaining-work note) — it will matter the
    moment this change wires one in.
  - Given that, the natural home for an operator's listing-mode preference
    is `ResourcePool.policy_tags` (`kit/resource-pools` — already a
    free-form, filterable `dict[str, Any]`, already exposed through the
    pool admin API's list/detail/export). A storefront that's colocated
    with (or trusts) a provisioning service could read a tag like
    `{"listing_mode": "specific_resource"}` off a pool and decide whether
    to publish that pool's listings as resource-pinned or pool-scoped.
  - This is explicitly a **hint**, not a constraint provisioning enforces:
    `pools-2`'s spec already commits to honoring an explicit `resource_id`
    request regardless of a pool's preferred mode (see this file's sibling
    Non-Goals entry). A third-party storefront that never reads the hint at
    all falls back to today's structural default (pool membership: a
    listing derived from a real multi-member pool is never resource-pinned;
    a listing derived from a single-resource pool carries that resource's
    `resource_id`).
  - Not designed here: the actual channel a storefront uses to learn a
    pool's `policy_tags` across the service boundary (poll the pool admin
    API? carried through CSV import? only relevant when storefront and
    provisioning share an operator?), and whether/how `_eligible_candidates`'s
    existing (undocumented) assumption that `SiteResource.attributes.pool_id`
    already matches a real `ResourcePoolService` pool ID should itself become
    an explicit, enforced sync rather than an implicit expectation.

## Accepted provider configuration

Durable fulfillment persistence must snapshot the accepted provider inputs needed for recovery and teardown so later pool edits cannot reinterpret already accepted work. Database uniqueness and dispatch recovery remain the cross-process idempotency boundary; POOLS-3's in-memory service intentionally provides only sequential retry behavior.

## Scope decision: retrofit, not compute-30 extraction (design review, 2026-07-17)

This session scoped POOLS-7 to retrofitting the existing VM domain
storefront and provisioning service onto the POOLS 1-4 machinery, not to
`market-platform-compute-30-extract-service`'s service extraction. kit
packages (`kit/site`, `kit/resource-pools`) and the `apicredits` domain
may be modified where genuinely cross-domain — this is permitted, not
required, and several of the decisions below exercise that permission.
The remainder of this section records what that design review settled.

### `SiteResource` is retired; replaced by two distinct, differently-scoped entities

Tracing why `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` and the storefront's local CSV
inventory could disagree about `pool_id` (see "Operator listing-mode
hints" above) surfaced a bigger problem than a missing sync: the
storefront was maintaining its own shadow copy of physical inventory
(`resources` table, hand-curated CSV) instead of treating the
provisioning service's `hosts`/`resource_pools` tables as authoritative.
Fixing the sync gap without fixing the ownership inversion would just
move where the drift originates.

Resolved shape:

- **`site_resource_pools`** (renamed from `SiteResource`, `kit/site`,
  hosted by the provisioning service) — stays **host-granular**, one row
  per physical resource, exactly as `SiteResource` is today. It is no
  longer independently authored by the storefront's CSV push; it is
  derived from the provisioning service's own `hosts` + `resource_pools`
  tables (POOLS-1), which are the actual single source of truth for host
  inventory and pool membership. `pool_id` becomes a real, enforced
  attribute rather than a storefront-authored guess that happens to
  collide with an operator pool ID.
- **`CapacityReservation`** (renamed from `SiteAllocation`) — the
  hold/lease-tail row. Its primary claim target changes from an
  always-concrete `resource_id` to `pool_id`; `settlement_resource_id`
  becomes a nullable field populated once, by `assign_settlement_resource`,
  when `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` makes its placement decision — not
  rebound from one resource to another the way an earlier draft of this
  review proposed. See "Host-granular matching is a feasibility
  guarantee, not an aggregation choice" below for why this is now Option
  A (reserve against one concrete resource up front; the scheduler
  reassigns among *equally eligible* resources) rather than Option B
  (reserve against a pool-level aggregate with no concrete resource until
  scheduling) from this change's earlier draft.
- **`CapacityProjection`** (storefront-side, new) — the storefront's
  read-only, pull-based mirror of every connected provisioning service's
  pool/capacity state (`GET /api/v1/pools`, which already exists and is
  already reachable — the storefront already holds the admin key for
  each configured site). This is the only place aggregation across hosts
  happens, and it is explicitly advisory/display-only (pricing, listing
  publication) — never the thing admission control checks against. Keyed
  by `(site, pool_id)`, since pool IDs are only unique per provisioning
  service.
- **Physical Resource** (vocabulary term, unchanged) — already used
  across kit with per-domain implementations; no change needed.

This decision explicitly extends beyond the VM domain: `apicredits`
today calls `CapacityLedgerService` directly with no pool concept at all
("token quota resources carry no host"). The intent is for `apicredits`
to also adopt a capacity-reservation-against-a-pooled-view shape, not
just the VM domain — `kit/site`'s reshape must stay generic enough to
carry a non-physical, non-host-shaped notion of "pool" (a quota bucket)
as well as VM's host-shaped one.

### Host-granular matching is a feasibility guarantee, not an aggregation choice (design review, 2026-07-17)

An earlier draft of this review proposed collapsing `site_resource_pools`
into one row per pool (aggregate `total_units`). **This is wrong and MUST
NOT be implemented**: today's row-per-host matching
(`_resource_matches`/`_find_candidate` in `kit/site/ledger.py`) is what
guarantees a reservation for N units only succeeds when *some single
host* actually has N units free — the arithmetic never sums across rows.
Replacing that with one pool-level aggregate row would let a reservation
succeed against a pool's total free capacity even when no single host in
that pool can serve the shape (e.g. 500 units free scattered one-per-host
across 500 machines, and a request for 4 units on one host). This is the
`pools-6` risk *"pool-level aggregation can hide that dimensions live on
different physical resources"* realized at **reservation** time instead
of scheduling time — worse, because it means accepting a deal the system
cannot structurally fulfill.

**Resolved:** `site_resource_pools` rows stay host-granular.
`CapacityReservation` binds to one concrete, feasibility-verified host at
reservation time (today's mechanism, just correctly sourced from
`hosts`/`resource_pools` instead of storefront CSV). This is "Option A"
from this change's earlier draft, not "Option B" (deferring all resource
selection to scheduling) — Option B is deferred to `pools-6` alongside
multidimensional capacity, not attempted here. `assign_settlement_resource`
remains a real, atomic capacity-transfer mechanism, but its role is
narrowed: a **fairness reassignment among already-equally-eligible
hosts**, not a relaxation of feasibility that reservation-time admission
already established.

### Reservation-time admission and scheduling-time eligibility MUST share one predicate

`kit/site/ledger.py`'s `_resource_matches` (reservation admission) and
`PhysicalSettlementScheduler._eligible_candidates` (scheduling
eligibility) are two independent implementations of "does this shape fit
this resource" today. This is the same class of bug as the `pool_id`
mismatch this review started from: two things that must agree, with
nothing forcing them to. Resolved direction: extract a single
`resource_satisfies_requirement(resource, requirement) -> bool` predicate
that both call sites use — reservation calls it to gate admission ("does
at least one host qualify"), scheduling calls it to build the eligible
set for policy selection. Exact home for this predicate (alongside
`PhysicalSettlementScheduler` in `compute_provisioning`, or in
`kit/site` where the resource rows themselves live) is not decided;
resolve during planning.

### `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` and `DeterministicRoundRobinPolicy` move to `compute_provisioning`, not `kit/resource-pools`

Both are already effectively domain-neutral (`DeterministicRoundRobinPolicy`
verified to contain zero VM-specific logic — it only sorts `pool_id`/
`resource_id` strings). Moving them out of VM-service-local code was
considered for `kit/resource-pools` (where `FulfillmentProvider`/
`ProviderRegistry` already live, per `pools-3`), but that destination is
**not viable**: `PhysicalSettlementScheduler` needs real runtime imports
from `compute_provisioning` (`SettlementCandidate`, `SettlementRequirement`,
`SettlementResource`, `PhysicalSettlementRequest` — constructed, not just
type-hinted, unlike `FulfillmentProvider`'s string-quoted forward
references), and `compute_provisioning` already depends on
`kit/resource-pools` (`provisioning/compute/pyproject.toml`). Adding the
reverse edge would close a cycle.

`compute_provisioning` has no such problem — it already depends on both
`kit/site` and `kit/resource-pools`, and the settlement types the
scheduler operates on already live there (`pools-2`). **Resolved:**
`PhysicalSettlementScheduler` and `DeterministicRoundRobinPolicy` move
into `compute_provisioning`.

This incidentally resolves part of the open, unresolved question
`market-platform-compute-30-extract-service` inherited from the closed
`pools-5-shared-provisioning-package` ("should `PhysicalSettlementScheduler`
... consolidate into `compute_provisioning`") — without POOLS-7 taking on
compute-30's actual service-extraction scope. This is the same kind of
narrow, deliberate override `pools-3` already made once for
`FulfillmentProvider`/`ProviderRegistry`; see that change's `design.md`,
"Domain-neutral contracts vs. domain-specific payloads." `compute-30`'s
proposal has been updated to reflect this as resolved rather than open.

Two pre-existing domain leaks were found while confirming this move is
safe, and should be fixed as part of it rather than carried into a
supposedly domain-neutral shared package:

- `kit/site/ledger.py`'s `_UNIT_CLAIM_KEYS = ("units", "gpu_count")` is a
  module-level constant hardcoding a VM-specific alias into otherwise
  domain-neutral ledger code. Should become a `CapacityLedgerService.__init__`
  parameter (default `("units",)`), with the VM composition root supplying
  `("units", "gpu_count")` explicitly — same pattern already used for
  `required_attributes`.
- `PhysicalSettlementScheduler._requirement`'s fallback
  (`resource_kind = ... or "compute.gpu"`) silently defaults to a
  VM-flavored value. Once shared across domains this default is wrong for
  `apicredits`. Should become a required field with no fallback, or an
  injected per-domain default at the composition root.

## Dependency on POOLS-6: multidimensional capacity is a prerequisite, not parallel work

Design review (2026-07-17) surfaced a correctness gap that blocks
`site_resource_pools`/`CapacityReservation` from being trustworthy even
with the host-granularity fix above: **`Host` (`domains/vms/provisioning/
service/src/db/models.py`) has no memory, disk, or vCPU capacity field —
only `gpu_count`.** Reservation admission can therefore verify GPU-count
bin-packing correctly but cannot verify that a negotiated shape
(vCPU/memory/disk, carried today only in `VmFulfillmentRequirements` at
*fulfillment* time, downstream of admission) actually fits any real
host. A reservation can be admitted for a shape no physical machine can
serve.

This is a real instance of `pools-6`'s deliberately-abstract problem
statement, not a new problem — see `pools-6-multidimensional-fair-scheduling/
proposal.md`'s "Concrete, currently-unenforced gap" addition. POOLS-7's
reservation-admission work depends on `pools-6` resolving multidimensional
capacity tracking; it is not POOLS-7's scope to solve, and POOLS-7 MUST
NOT quietly re-derive a partial answer (e.g. adding only a memory field to
`Host` without going through `pools-6`'s design questions on dimension
normalization, units, and fairness) in order to unblock itself. Sequencing:
`pools-6` resolves multidimensional capacity vectors first; POOLS-7's
reservation-admission and scheduling-eligibility work (including the
shared `resource_satisfies_requirement` predicate above) consumes that
result rather than working around its absence.
