# Tasks — repair-storefront-alkahest-configuration

## Implementation status

**Implemented, unverified against the stack.** All three gaps are closed and
each fix is verified against the real packages at unit level. The e2e run that
confirms settlement becomes ready has not happened yet.

## 1. Supply the EVM credential

- [x] 1.1 Add `STOREFRONT_WALLET__PRIVATE_KEY` for `bob-storefront` and
      `alice-storefront` to `compose.local-identities.yml`, `@str`-marked.
      Anvil 2 for Bob and Anvil 4 for Alice, each derived and checked against
      the `Wallet.address` its own storefront config declares.
- [x] 1.2 Record at the call site why the name differs from the `AGENT_PRIV_KEY`
      the adjacent env files supply, so the next reader does not "fix" it back.

## 2. Make the address configuration reachable

- [x] 2.1 Bind-mount `alkahest_anvil_addresses.json` to
      `/app/alkahest_anvil_addresses.json` for both VM storefronts in
      `domains/vms/compose.yml`, matching the API-credits convention.
- [x] 2.2 Point `Settlement.alkahest.address_config_path` at the mount in
      `storefront.bob.toml` and `storefront.alice.toml`.
- [x] 2.3 Add `Chains.anvil.alkahest_address_config_path`, which client
      construction reads separately from the readiness preflight, and note
      that the two reads are independent.

## 3. Validation

- [x] 3.1 `build_alkahest_clients` reproduces the production symptom with no
      credential and proceeds past address-config resolution with one, failing
      only on DNS for the compose-internal RPC host.
- [x] 3.2 `alkahest_preflight` carries `alkahest.address_config_invalid` for
      the current path and not for the mounted one.
- [ ] 3.3 `make -C e2e-tests test-e2e`: confirm `checks.alkahest` reports
      `anvil`, that no `[SETTLEMENT] option suppressed` line names
      `alkahest.v1`, and that the seven listing-create refusals are gone.
      Compare failure *causes*, not counts — the escrow phases have never run,
      so new failures downstream of a now-publishing listing are the expected
      result and are findings for classification, not regressions.
- [ ] 3.4 `make test` stays green. No production Python changed, so nothing is
      expected here; run it rather than assume.

## 3e. Fan-in conversion and a misleading assertion

Round result: **8 failed, 55 passed, 38 skipped** from 9/54/38.

- [x] 3e.1 **The fan-in signing worked; my conversion did not.** The typed
      client returned results and I then called `model_dump` on them.
      `ListingListResponse.listings` holds `ListingSummary` dataclasses whose
      serializer is `to_dict`, so every URL failed with
      `'ListingSummary' object has no attribute 'model_dump'` — after the
      request had already succeeded. Replaced the defensive `getattr` chain
      with the two names the class actually has. This is the branch's own
      lesson landing on me: `ListingListResponse` is exactly the type that
      taught it, and I modelled it instead of reading it.
- [x] 3e.2 **An assertion that gave inverted guidance.** Stage 05a's
      evaluate-negotiate check now reaches a real decision (`200 OK`), and got
      `reject`. Its failure message was written for `accept` only: it reported
      "Strategy accepted at round 0", told the reader to *lower* the opening
      price, and printed neither the decision nor the reason. Following it
      would have moved the price the wrong way. Now reports the actual
      decision, reason, and both reference amounts, and separates the guidance
      for `accept` from `reject` while warning that a guard can decline for
      reasons unrelated to price.

      Deliberately not tuned `BUYER_INITIAL_PRICE`: the reason is not yet
      known, and choosing a price to make a red test green without it would be
      guessing at the scenario's intent.

- [ ] 3e.3 **Findings unchanged:** `409 No available compute VM` (2),
      `500 UNIQUE constraint failed: ...derivation_key` (1), `market credits
      buy` `rc=2` (1), and `market buy` exiting `rc=0` without a run-log (1).

## 4. Closeout

- [ ] 4.1 **Comment hygiene.** `make check-comment-hygiene`.
- [ ] 4.2 **Import placement.** No Python changed; record that disposition.
- [ ] 4.3 **Documentation compliance.** Confirm the no-permanent-change
      disposition still holds once the stack result is known.
- [ ] 4.4 **Narrative compression.** Reduce these notes to final state.
- [ ] 4.5 **Roadmap currency.** Expected to own nothing; record either way.
- [ ] 4.6 **Campaign index currency.** Move the alkahest item out of the
      campaign's unowned table into this change's row, and reconcile on
      archival.
- [ ] 4.7 **Promotion.** Complete the design-promotion record.

## Design promotion record

## Deferred, carried out of this change

- [ ] 5.1 Converge compose configuration onto a single source shared with the
      tests, and reconcile it with the Helm charts, which express the same
      deployment more coherently. Accepted as follow-up during this change and
      deliberately not attempted here.
- [ ] 5.2 Stop the shared Dynaconf loader TOML-parsing environment values bound
      for string fields, so `0x`-prefixed credentials do not need `@str` per
      value. Second occurrence of the workaround; also carried as an inherited
      question from `provide-e2e-development-identities`.
- [ ] 5.3 Delete or rewrite `domains/vms/storefront/.env.{bob,alice}.docker`,
      which carry configuration for a layout that no longer exists, including a
      stale `ALKAHEST_ADDRESS_CONFIG_PATH`. Left in place because the compose
      files still reference them.
