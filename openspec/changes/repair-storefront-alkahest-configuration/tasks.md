# Tasks — repair-storefront-alkahest-configuration

## Implementation status

**Implemented, unverified against the stack.** All three gaps are closed and
each fix is verified against the real packages at unit level. The e2e run that
confirms settlement becomes ready has not happened yet.

## 1. Supply the EVM credential

- [x] 1.1 Add `STOREFRONT_WALLET__PRIVATE_KEY` for `bob-storefront` and
      `alice-storefront` to `compose.local-identities.yml`, `@str`-marked.
      Anvil 2 for Bob and Anvil 4 for Alice, each derived and checked against
      the `Wallet.address` its own storefront config declares.
- [x] 1.2 Record at the call site why the name differs from the `AGENT_PRIV_KEY`
      the adjacent env files supply, so the next reader does not "fix" it back.

## 2. Make the address configuration reachable

- [x] 2.1 Bind-mount `alkahest_anvil_addresses.json` to
      `/app/alkahest_anvil_addresses.json` for both VM storefronts in
      `domains/vms/compose.yml`, matching the API-credits convention.
- [x] 2.2 Point `Settlement.alkahest.address_config_path` at the mount in
      `storefront.bob.toml` and `storefront.alice.toml`.
- [x] 2.3 Add `Chains.anvil.alkahest_address_config_path`, which client
      construction reads separately from the readiness preflight, and note
      that the two reads are independent.

## 3. Validation

- [x] 3.1 `build_alkahest_clients` reproduces the production symptom with no
      credential and proceeds past address-config resolution with one, failing
      only on DNS for the compose-internal RPC host.
- [x] 3.2 `alkahest_preflight` carries `alkahest.address_config_invalid` for
      the current path and not for the mounted one.
- [ ] 3.3 `make -C e2e-tests test-e2e`: confirm `checks.alkahest` reports
      `anvil`, that no `[SETTLEMENT] option suppressed` line names
      `alkahest.v1`, and that the seven listing-create refusals are gone.
      Compare failure *causes*, not counts — the escrow phases have never run,
      so new failures downstream of a now-publishing listing are the expected
      result and are findings for classification, not regressions.
- [ ] 3.4 `make test` stays green. No production Python changed, so nothing is
      expected here; run it rather than assume.

## 3h. Restore the deleted scenario stages

- [x] 3h.1 Eleven stages restored from commit `a1128a4c`, 514 lines: four
      `pauses_the_storefront_loops`, five
      `registers_executor_host_and_syncs_projection`,
      `test_09bb_claims_cycle_registers_the_seller_claim`, and
      `test_10a_expire_lease_and_arm_teardown_gate`. Seven arrived as whole
      classes that had been removed; placement was computed by comparing class
      order against the August file rather than guessed, because pytest runs
      stages in file order and a capacity declaration after the listing it
      backs is useless.
- [x] 3h.2 Collection rises 127 → 140, with all 11 stages selected.
- [x] 3h.3 **Signature check over the restored code**, extended this round to
      flag calls to methods that do not exist at all — the earlier version
      skipped them, which is why it reported clean while three were broken.

- [ ] 3h.4 **Six pre-existing mismatches surfaced by the stronger check.**
      Verified present in the checkpoint before this restoration, so not
      introduced here:

      | Site | Problem |
      |---|---|
      | `test_compute_dynamic_listings.py` ×4 | reaches into `storefront_admin_client._post` and `._admin_headers` — private helpers, and `_admin_headers` belongs to the retired shared-key model |
      | `test_full_deal.py`, `test_full_deal_buyer_cli.py` | call `admin_release_one_reservation`, which the client no longer exposes |

      The private-helper reach-through is the more interesting one: a test that
      calls a client's internals bypasses exactly the signed-request
      construction the client exists to own, so it would keep working while the
      public path was broken. Both need a public route or a recorded reason,
      and the release call needs its replacement identified.

## 4. Closeout

- [ ] 4.1 **Comment hygiene.** `make check-comment-hygiene`.
- [ ] 4.2 **Import placement.** No Python changed; record that disposition.
- [ ] 4.3 **Documentation compliance.** Confirm the no-permanent-change
      disposition still holds once the stack result is known.
- [ ] 4.4 **Narrative compression.** Reduce these notes to final state.
- [ ] 4.5 **Roadmap currency.** Expected to own nothing; record either way.
- [ ] 4.6 **Campaign index currency.** Move the alkahest item out of the
      campaign's unowned table into this change's row, and reconcile on
      archival.
- [ ] 4.7 **Promotion.** Complete the design-promotion record.

## Design promotion record

| Accepted decision | Permanent location |
|---|---|
| *(none expected — configuration only; the conventions relied on are already demonstrated elsewhere in the repository)* | — |

## Deferred, carried out of this change

- [ ] 5.1 Converge compose configuration onto a single source shared with the
      tests, and reconcile it with the Helm charts, which express the same
      deployment more coherently. Accepted as follow-up during this change and
      deliberately not attempted here.
- [ ] 5.2 Stop the shared Dynaconf loader TOML-parsing environment values bound
      for string fields, so `0x`-prefixed credentials do not need `@str` per
      value. Second occurrence of the workaround; also carried as an inherited
      question from `provide-e2e-development-identities`.
- [ ] 5.3 Delete or rewrite `domains/vms/storefront/.env.{bob,alice}.docker`,
      which carry configuration for a layout that no longer exists, including a
      stale `ALKAHEST_ADDRESS_CONFIG_PATH`. Left in place because the compose
      files still reference them.
